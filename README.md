IoT to predict the weather


an IoT (Internet of Things)-based weather reporting system can provide all of the climatic information via the internet, including temperature, humidity, rain, and others.

build an IoT-based weather reporting system using a microcontroller, sensors, and a device that can connect to the internet (such as a Raspberry Pi). This code is written in C++, but you can adapt it to any other programming language that is supported by your microcontroller and internet device.

First, you will need to set up your microcontroller and sensors to collect data from the environment. You can use sensors such as a temperature sensor, a humidity sensor, and a rain sensor to measure the temperature, humidity, and amount of rain, respectively. You will need to write code to read the values from these sensors and store them in variables.

Next, you will need to set up your internet device to send this data to a server over the internet. You can do this using a variety of protocols, such as HTTP or MQTT. You will need to write code to connect to the internet, send the data to the server, and receive any responses from the server.

Finally, you will need to set up a server to receive the data from your internet device and store it in a database. You can use a variety of technologies to build the server, such as a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP). You will need to write code to receive the data from the internet device, store it in the database, and provide an interface for users to access the data.
